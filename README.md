# BASH TWEAKS ETC

BASH, MC, Nano miscellanous little customizations with easy to use interactive install script.

What this repo (I mean `install.sh` script) does:
1. Setup BASH colors variables and make pretty (in my opinion) command line prompt.
2. Setup some convenient (in my opinion, again) aliases.
3. Allow to choose MC, mceditor, mcview skins.
4. Increase BASH history size.
5. Add context history search to BASH.
6. Change Nano and MC settings related to tabs'n'spaces, set 4 spaces tabs and fill tabs with spaces (controversial moment, yes, but suits for me).
