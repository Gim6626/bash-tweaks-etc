# BASH TWEAKS ETC

![](img/logo256.png)

BASH, MC, Nano, Vim, Tmux miscellanous small customizations with easy to use interactive install script.

What this repo (i.e. `install.sh` script) does:
1. Setup BASH colors variables and make pretty (in my opinion) command line prompt.
2. Setup some convenient (in my opinion, again) aliases.
3. Allow to choose MC, mceditor, mcview skins.
4. Increase BASH and Tmux history size.
5. Add context history search to BASH.
6. Change MC, Nano, Vim settings related to tabs'n'spaces, set 4 spaces tabs and fill tabs with spaces (controversial moment, yes, but suits for me).
7. Allow to choose default editor for EDITOR environment variable and `edit` command from `mailcap` set.
